we have a very detailed api

make the frontend

at a high level

user signs up
they have no program thats fine
then they sign up for a program
run it to completion 
select their next program
ad infinitum 

use /frontend-design skill to get it going

use /agent-browser skill to test stuff

you'll need to install shit thats fine probably a lot of it

don't overuse cards it looks like shit

must be mobile and desktop friendly everywhere 2 breakpoints not 3 no one is using this on tablet

frontend is bun + vite + react + typescript

its a spa with go backend with json apis
