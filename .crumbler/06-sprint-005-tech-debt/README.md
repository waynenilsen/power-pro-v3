# Sprint 005 - Technical Debt (Phase 2)

## Overview

Per roadmap rules, every 5th sprint must be a technical debt paydown sprint.

## Focus Areas

Review and address technical debt accumulated during Phase 002 sprints:

1. **Auth Code Review** - Ensure auth implementation follows best practices
2. **Session Management** - Review session cleanup, expiration handling
3. **Test Coverage** - Ensure new auth/profile/dashboard code is well-tested
4. **Code Consistency** - Ensure new code follows established patterns
5. **Documentation Sync** - Update API docs for new endpoints

## Tasks

1. Create sprint directory: `phases/in-progress/002-frontend-readiness/sprints/todo/005-technical-debt-phase2/`
2. Write `prd.md` - Product requirements (short, focused on tech debt)
3. Write `erd.md` - Engineering requirements for debt paydown
4. Create ticket directory structure
5. Create tickets (at least 5):
   - Security audit of auth implementation
   - Session cleanup and expiration tests
   - Test coverage review for new endpoints
   - Code pattern consistency review
   - API documentation update

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Sprint directory structure exists
- [ ] PRD document completed (can be brief for tech debt)
- [ ] ERD document completed with REQ-XXX requirements
- [ ] At least 5 tickets created in `tickets/todo/`
- [ ] Tickets reference ERD requirements
