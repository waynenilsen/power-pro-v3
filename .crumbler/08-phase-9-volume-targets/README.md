# Phase 9: Volume Targets

Implement total rep targets and session-level volume tracking.

## Features to Implement

- **SetScheme: `TotalReps`** - Target total reps regardless of set structure
- **Session-level rep tracking** - Track cumulative reps across sets
- **Superset notation** - Define exercises performed back-to-back

## Programs Unlocked

| Program | Why |
|---------|-----|
| 5/3/1 Building the Monolith | "100 chin-ups", "100-200 dips" however you get them |

## Acceptance Criteria

- Users can prescribe total rep targets (e.g., "100 reps")
- System tracks progress toward target across multiple sets
- User can distribute reps across sets as they prefer
- E2E tests demonstrate Building the Monolith program
