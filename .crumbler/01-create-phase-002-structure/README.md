## Tasks

1. Create directory structure:
   ```
   phases/in-progress/002-frontend-readiness/
   phases/in-progress/002-frontend-readiness/sprints/
   phases/in-progress/002-frontend-readiness/sprints/todo/
   phases/in-progress/002-frontend-readiness/sprints/in-progress/
   phases/in-progress/002-frontend-readiness/sprints/done/
   phases/in-progress/002-frontend-readiness/sprints/not-doing/
   ```

2. Create phase document `002-frontend-readiness.md` with:
   - Vision: Make the API frontend-ready with real authentication, user profiles, and aggregated endpoints
   - Strategic Objectives: Enable frontend development, real user management, improved DX
   - Themes: Authentication, User Management, API Aggregation, Program Content
