# 003: Wendler 5/3/1 Program Seed

## ERD Reference
Implements: REQ-SEED-003

## Description
Create a goose migration that seeds the Wendler 5/3/1 program into the database. This program uses monthly periodization with a 4-week cycle structure based on percentages of a Training Max.

## Context / Background
Wendler 5/3/1 is one of the most popular percentage-based programs. Each main lift is trained once per week on its own day. The program runs in 4-week cycles: Week 1 (5s), Week 2 (3s), Week 3 (5/3/1), Week 4 (deload). All weights are calculated from a Training Max (TM), which is 90% of the lifter's true 1RM.

Reference: `programs/003-wendler-531-bbb.md`

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create goose migration file: `NNNN_seed_531.sql`
- [ ] Create program record:
  - slug: `531`
  - name: `Wendler 5/3/1`
  - description: Brief description of the percentage-based philosophy
  - author: system user
- [ ] Create 4 workout days (one per main lift):
  - Day 1: Overhead Press
  - Day 2: Deadlift
  - Day 3: Bench Press
  - Day 4: Squat
- [ ] Create Week 1 ("5s Week") prescriptions for each day:
  - Set 1: 65% of TM x 5 reps
  - Set 2: 75% of TM x 5 reps
  - Set 3: 85% of TM x 5+ reps (AMRAP)
- [ ] Create Week 2 ("3s Week") prescriptions for each day:
  - Set 1: 70% of TM x 3 reps
  - Set 2: 80% of TM x 3 reps
  - Set 3: 90% of TM x 3+ reps (AMRAP)
- [ ] Create Week 3 ("5/3/1 Week") prescriptions for each day:
  - Set 1: 75% of TM x 5 reps
  - Set 2: 85% of TM x 3 reps
  - Set 3: 95% of TM x 1+ reps (AMRAP)
- [ ] Create Week 4 ("Deload Week") prescriptions for each day:
  - Set 1: 40% of TM x 5 reps
  - Set 2: 50% of TM x 5 reps
  - Set 3: 60% of TM x 5 reps
- [ ] Create cycle progression model:
  - Upper body (Press, Bench): +5 lbs per 4-week cycle
  - Lower body (Squat, Deadlift): +10 lbs per 4-week cycle
- [ ] Model TM concept (90% of 1RM as base for percentages)
- [ ] Migration includes proper down migration
- [ ] Migration is idempotent

## Technical Notes
- This is the most complex program to model due to:
  - 4-week cycle structure
  - Different prescriptions per week
  - Percentage-based weights (need TM concept)
  - AMRAP sets (need to mark last set as AMRAP)
- Key insight: percentages are of Training Max, not 1RM
- The + notation indicates AMRAP (As Many Reps As Possible)
- May need 16 prescription sets (4 days x 4 weeks) or use week templates
- Consider how schema models week variations - may need program_weeks table
- Cycle length = 4 weeks; progression happens at cycle boundary

## Dependencies
- Blocks: 005 (verification tests need all programs seeded)
- Blocked by: 002 (run in sequence)
