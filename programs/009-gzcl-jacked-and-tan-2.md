# GZCL Jacked and Tan 2.0 - Complete Algorithm Specification

## Program Overview

Jacked and Tan 2.0 (J&T 2.0) is a 12-week strength and hypertrophy program created by Cody Lefever (GZCL). The program is designed for intermediate to advanced lifters seeking to build both size and strength through a combination of rep max (RM) finding, volume accumulation, and intelligent periodization.

The program is built on GZCL's tiered training methodology, emphasizing high-quality movement practice on competition lifts while accumulating significant training volume through accessory work.

## Program Structure

### Block Periodization

The program is divided into **four mesocycles (blocks)** across 12 weeks:

| Mesocycle | Weeks | Primary Focus |
|-----------|-------|---------------|
| **Mesocycle A** | 1-3 | Volume accumulation, higher rep RM testing (10RM to 6RM) |
| **Mesocycle B** | 4-6 | Strength building, moderate rep RM testing (5RM to 3RM), Week 6 is T1 Test/T2 Deload |
| **Mesocycle C** | 7-9 | Intensity phase, lower rep RM testing (6RM to 2RM), Week 9 is peak test |
| **Mesocycle D** | 10-12 | Peaking phase, final RM testing (5RM to 1RM), Week 12 is max attempt week |

---

## Training Frequency

The base program utilizes **4-5 training days per week**:

- **Day One**: Squat focus
- **Day Two**: Bench Press focus
- **Day Three**: Deadlift focus
- **Day Four**: Overhead Press focus
- **Day Five** (optional): Secondary pressing movement (Push Press)
- **Days Six & Seven**: Rest days

---

## Rep Max (RM) Progression

### T1 RM Progression by Week

The program systematically reduces the target RM each week while increasing intensity:

| Week | T1 RM Target | Purpose |
|------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | Find 10RM | Establish baseline, high volume |
| 2 | Find 8RM | Moderate volume |
| 3 | Find 6RM | Transition to strength |
| 4 | Find 5RM | Strength focus |
| 5 | Find 4RM | Heavy strength |
| 6 | Find 3RM | T1 Test Week, T2 Deload |
| 7 | Find 6RM | Reset, new block begins |
| 8 | Find 4RM | Building intensity |
| 9 | Find 2RM | Peak test week |
| 10 | Find 5RM | Deload/reset |
| 11 | Find 3RM | Pre-max week |
| 12 | Find 1RM | Max attempt week |

### T2a RM Progression by Week

T2a movements follow a similar but offset progression:

| Week | T2a RM Target |
|------|--------------|
| 1 | Find 10RM |
| 2 | Find 9RM |
| 3 | Find 8RM |
| 4 | Find 7RM |
| 5 | Find 6RM |
| 6 | T2 Rest (deload) |
| 7 | Find 10RM |
| 8 | Find 9RM |
| 9 | Find 8RM |
| 10 | Find 7RM |
| 11 | Find 6RM |
| 12 | Find 1RM (optional) |

---

## Back-Off Set Protocols

After finding the RM for the day, perform back-off sets based on the week:

### T1 Back-Off Sets

The notation "X -- Y -- Z" means: minimum sets -- typical sets -- maximum sets

| Week | RM | Rep Multiplier | Set Range |
|------|-----|----------------|-----------|
| 1 | 10RM | x5 reps | 2 -- 4 -- 6 sets |
| 2 | 8RM | x4 reps | 2 -- 4 -- 6 sets |
| 3 | 6RM | x1 rep (singles) | 2 -- 6 -- 9 sets |
| 4 | 5RM | x1 rep (singles) | 1 -- 5 -- 8 sets |
| 5 | 4RM | x1 rep (singles) | 1 -- 4 -- 7 sets |
| 6 | 3RM | x1 rep (singles) | 1 -- 3 -- 6 sets |
| 7 | 6RM | x1 rep (singles) | 2 -- 6 -- 9 sets |
| 8 | 4RM | x1 rep (singles) | 1 -- 4 -- 7 sets |
| 9 | 2RM | 5+ (AMRAP) | Single AMRAP set at 85% TM |
| 10 | 5RM | x1 rep (singles) | 1 -- 5 -- 8 sets |
| 11 | 3RM | x1 rep (singles) | 1 -- 3 -- 6 sets |
| 12 | 1RM | None | Max attempt only |

### T2a Back-Off Sets

| Week | RM | Rep Multiplier | Set Range |
|------|-----|----------------|-----------|
| 1 | 10RM | x5 reps | 2 -- 4 -- 6 sets |
| 2 | 9RM | x4-5 reps | 2 -- 4 -- 6 sets |
| 3 | 8RM | x4 reps | 2 -- 4 -- 6 sets |
| 4 | 7RM | x3-4 reps | 2 -- 4 -- 6 sets |
| 5 | 6RM | x3 reps | 2 -- 4 -- 6 sets |
| 6 | Rest | - | - |
| 7-11 | Follows similar pattern | Varies | 2 -- 4 -- 6 sets |

---

## MRS (Max Rep Sets) Protocol

The Max Rep Sets protocol is used for T2b, T2c, and all T3 exercises.

### How MRS Works

1. **Work up to target weight**: Find a weight that allows you to complete the target reps with good form
2. **Perform the target rep set**: Complete the prescribed number of reps
3. **Perform 3 additional MRS**: Using the same weight, complete 3 more sets to near-failure (leave 1-2 reps in reserve)

### MRS Notation

"? x [reps] 3MRS" means:
- Work up to a weight (?) where you can complete [reps]
- Then perform 3 additional Max Rep Sets with that weight

### Rep Expectations

- Rep counts will naturally drop on each successive MRS
- Example: Target 10 reps might result in 10, 8, 7, 6 across the 4 total sets
- Never push to absolute failure - always leave 1-2 reps in reserve

---

## T2b/T2c Rep Progression

| Week | T2b/T2c Reps |
|------|-------------|
| 1 | 15 |
| 2 | 12 |
| 3 | 10 |
| 4 | 8 |
| 5 | 6 |
| 6 | Rest or light (10 reps) |
| 7 | 12 |
| 8 | 10 |
| 9 | 8 |
| 10 | 6 |
| 11 | Rest (some T3 only at 12 reps) |
| 12 | Rest |

---

## T3 Rep Progression

| Week | T3 Reps |
|------|---------|
| 1 | 20 |
| 2 | 18 |
| 3 | 16 |
| 4 | 14 |
| 5 | 12 |
| 6 | 10 |
| 7 | Rest |
| 8 | 18 |
| 9 | 16 |
| 10 | 14 |
| 11 | 12 |
| 12 | Rest |

## Training Max (TM) System

### Initial Setup

The Training Max is an estimated daily 2RM - a weight you could confidently double on any given day. This is typically 90-95% of true 1RM.

### T1 Percentage Progression (Based on TM)

These percentages apply to volume/back-off work when calculated loads are used:

**Squat and Deadlift (heavier lifts)**:
| Week | Percentage |
|------|-----------|
| 1 | 70% |
| 2 | 75% |
| 3 | 80% |
| 4 | 82.5% |
| 5 | 85% |

**Bench Press**:
| Week | Percentage |
|------|-----------|
| 1 | 65% |
| 2 | 70% |
| 3 | 75% |
| 4 | 77.5% |
| 5 | 80% |

**Overhead Press**:
| Week | Percentage |
|------|-----------|
| 1 | 60% |
| 2 | 65% |
| 3 | 70% |
| 4 | 77.5% |
| 5 | 80% |

### T2a Percentage Progression

T2a exercises using barbell variations follow similar percentage schemes but start lower:

**Higher percentage T2s** (Front Squat, Pendlay Row):
| Week | Percentage |
|------|-----------|
| 1 | 70% |
| 2 | 75% |
| 3 | 80% |
| 4 | 82.5% |
| 5 | 85% |

**Lower percentage T2s** (Deficit Deadlift, Incline Bench, Close Grip Bench):
| Week | Percentage |
|------|-----------|
| 1 | 45-50% |
| 2 | 50-55% |
| 3 | 55-60% |
| 4 | 57.5-62.5% |
| 5 | 60-65% |

---

## Volume Accumulation Phases

### Block 1 (Weeks 1-6): High Volume Phase

- **Focus**: Finding current rep max ability, building work capacity
- **T1**: Higher rep RM finding (10RM down to 3RM) with substantial back-off volume
- **T2**: Progressive loading with RM finding
- **T3**: Highest rep ranges (20 down to 10)
- **Week 6**: Test week for T1, deload for T2

### Block 2 (Weeks 7-12): Intensity/Peaking Phase

- **Focus**: Converting volume to strength, peaking for max attempts
- **Week 7**: Reset with T3 rest, T2 variety option
- **Weeks 8-9**: Building intensity, Week 9 is 2RM test with AMRAP at 85%
- **Weeks 10-11**: Final strength building
- **Week 12**: Max attempt week - T1 1RM only, all other tiers rest

---

## Peaking Structure

### Week 6: Mid-Program Test

- T1: Find 3RM (test current strength)
- T2: Complete rest (deload)
- T3: Reduced volume (10 reps)

### Week 9: Peak Test Week

- T1: Find 2RM, then single AMRAP set at 85% Training Max (5+ reps target)
- T2a: Continue normal progression (8RM)
- T2b/T2c: Normal work (8 reps)
- T3: Normal work (16 reps)

### Week 11: Pre-Max Week

- T1: Find 3RM with reduced back-off volume
- T2a: 6RM with back-off sets
- T2b/T2c: Rest or very light
- T3: Light work (12 reps) - some movements rest

### Week 12: Max Week

- T1: Find 1RM (true max attempt)
- T2: Complete rest
- T3: Complete rest
- This week may align with a competition or personal testing

---

## AMRAP Guidelines

### When to AMRAP

- The (+) notation indicates last set should be an AMRAP
- AMRAPs are optional when feeling fatigued or run down
- Primary AMRAP opportunities occur on T1 back-off sets and Week 9 test

### AMRAP Execution

- Goal: Achieve approximately 2x the written rep target
- Never go to absolute failure
- Always leave 1-2 reps in reserve
- If the Training Max feels too heavy, skip the AMRAP for that session

---

## Exercise Selection Guidelines

### T1 Movement Selection

Must be competition lifts or extremely close variations:
- **Squat**: Back Squat (high bar or low bar)
- **Bench**: Competition Bench Press
- **Deadlift**: Conventional or Sumo (whichever is competition stance)
- **Press**: Strict Overhead Press or Push Press

### T2a Movement Selection

Close variations that build the T1 lifts:
- **Squat variations**: Front Squat, Pause Squat, Tempo Squat
- **Bench variations**: Close Grip Bench, Pause Bench, Spoto Press
- **Deadlift variations**: Deficit Deadlift, Opposite stance, Block Pulls
- **Press variations**: Incline Bench, Push Press, DB Shoulder Press

### T2b/T2c Movement Selection

Compound accessories:
- Leg Press, Lunges, Romanian Deadlift
- Incline Bench, DB Bench, Dips
- Rows (Barbell, Cable, Machine)
- Pulldowns, Pull-ups

### T3 Movement Selection

Isolation and machine work:
- Leg Curl, Leg Extension

---

## Rest Period Guidelines

| Tier | Rest Between Sets |
|------|------------------|
| T1 (RM set) | 3-5 minutes |
| T1 (back-off singles) | 2-3 minutes |
| T2a | 2-4 minutes after RM, 1-2 minutes between half-sets |
| T2b/T2c | 2-3 minutes |
| T3 | 30-90 seconds |

---

## Autoregulation Notes

### Weight Selection for T2b/T2c/T3

The "?" symbol indicates autoregulated weight selection:
- Choose a weight where you can complete the target reps with 1-2 reps in reserve
- Weight should feel challenging but not maximal
- Increase weight when you can complete all MRS sets with the target reps
- Decrease weight if form breaks down or you cannot complete target reps

### RM Finding Protocol

1. Warm up progressively to estimated RM weight
2. Attempt the target RM (e.g., 8RM)
3. If successful, consider a small increase if confident
4. If failed, reduce weight and complete the RM
5. Record the achieved RM for tracking

### Fatigue Management

If feeling run down:
- Skip AMRAPs
- Use fewer back-off sets (stick to minimum range)
- Reduce T3 volume or skip entirely
- Consider skipping a training day

## Program Notes and Tips

1. **Training Max Accuracy**: The TM should be conservative - a weight you could confidently hit for 2 reps on your worst day

2. **RM Finding**: Don't chase PRs every session. The goal is to find your daily RM, which will vary based on fatigue and recovery

3. **Volume Flexibility**: The set ranges (e.g., 2-4-6) give flexibility. Use more sets when feeling good, fewer when fatigued

4. **T3 Is Optional When Necessary**: If time or energy is limited, T3 can be reduced or skipped. Never skip T1

5. **Exercise Variety**: The program suggests changing some T2 and T3 exercises at Week 7 to prevent staleness and address weaknesses

6. **Competition Prep**: Week 12 can be aligned with a powerlifting meet. Adjust Week 11-12 timing based on competition schedule

7. **Record Everything**: Track all RMs found, back-off volumes completed, and T3 weights/reps for progression
