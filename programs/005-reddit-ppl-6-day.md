# Reddit PPL 6-Day Program Specification

## Overview

The Reddit PPL (Push/Pull/Legs) is a 6-day linear progression program designed for beginners to early intermediates. It follows a repeating Push/Pull/Legs split performed twice per week with one rest day, creating a 7-day microcycle.

## Program Structure

### Weekly Schedule

The program operates on a fixed 7-day rotation:

| Day | Workout Type | Primary Focus |
|-----|--------------|---------------|
| Day 1 (Monday) | Pull | Back, Biceps, Rear Delts |
| Day 2 (Tuesday) | Push | Chest, Shoulders, Triceps |
| Day 3 (Wednesday) | Legs | Quadriceps, Hamstrings, Calves |
| Day 4 (Thursday) | Pull | Back, Biceps, Rear Delts |
| Day 5 (Friday) | Push | Chest, Shoulders, Triceps |
| Day 6 (Saturday) | Legs | Quadriceps, Hamstrings, Calves |
| Day 7 (Sunday) | Rest | Recovery |

### Key Programming Principles

1. **Compound-First Approach**: Each workout begins with the primary compound movement
2. **Alternating Primary Lifts**: The two Pull days and two Push days feature different primary movements
3. **Linear Progression**: Main compound lifts follow a linear progression model
4. **Volume Accumulation**: Accessory work uses higher rep ranges for hypertrophy

## Pull Day A (Day 1)

### Exercise Selection and Prescription

| Order | Exercise | Sets x Reps | Progression Type |
|-------|----------|-------------|------------------|
| 1 | Deadlifts | 1x5+ | AMRAP with linear progression |
| 2 | Lat Pulldowns / Pull-ups / Chin-ups | 3x8-12 | Double progression |
| 3 | Chest Supported Rows / Seated Cable Rows | 3x8-12 | Double progression |
| 4 | Face Pulls | 5x15-20 | Volume-based |
| 5 | Hammer Curls | 4x8-12 | Double progression |
| 6 | Dumbbell Curls | 4x8-12 | Double progression |

### Notes
- Deadlifts are performed as a single AMRAP set (As Many Reps As Possible) with a minimum target of 5 reps
- The "+" notation indicates the lifter should perform additional reps beyond 5 if possible
- Pull-up variations are interchangeable based on equipment and preference

## Push Day A (Day 2)

### Exercise Selection and Prescription

| Order | Exercise | Sets x Reps | Progression Type |
|-------|----------|-------------|------------------|
| 1 | Bench Press | 4x5, 1x5+ | Linear progression with AMRAP finisher |
| 2 | Overhead Press | 3x8-12 | Double progression |
| 3 | Incline Dumbbell Press | 3x8-12 | Double progression |
| 4 | Triceps Pushdowns SS Lateral Raises | 3x8-12 / 3x15-20 | Superset |
| 5 | Overhead Triceps Extensions SS Lateral Raises | 3x8-12 / 3x15-20 | Superset |

### Notes
- Bench Press is the primary compound movement on this day
- The notation "4x5, 1x5+" means 4 sets of 5 reps followed by 1 AMRAP set
- "SS" indicates a superset - perform both exercises back-to-back with no rest between them
- Lateral raises are performed twice (6 total sets) to emphasize shoulder development

## Legs Day A (Day 3)

### Exercise Selection and Prescription

| Order | Exercise | Sets x Reps | Progression Type |
|-------|----------|-------------|------------------|
| 1 | Squat | 2x5, 1x5+ | Linear progression with AMRAP finisher |
| 2 | Romanian Deadlift | 3x8-12 | Double progression |
| 3 | Leg Press | 3x8-12 | Double progression |
| 4 | Leg Curls | 3x8-12 | Double progression |
| 5 | Calf Raises | 5x8-12 | Volume-based |

### Notes
- Squat is the primary compound movement
- The notation "2x5, 1x5+" means 2 sets of 5 reps followed by 1 AMRAP set
- Romanian Deadlift provides hamstring emphasis
- High volume calf work (5 sets) addresses the calves' higher recovery capacity

## Progression Schemes

### Linear Progression (Main Compound Lifts)

**Applies to:**
- Deadlifts (1x5+)
- Bench Press (4x5, 1x5+ / 3x8-12)
- Squat (2x5, 1x5+)
- Barbell Rows (4x5, 1x5+)
- Overhead Press (4x5, 1x5+ / 3x8-12)

**Progression Rules:**
1. When the lifter successfully completes all prescribed sets and reps, increase the weight for the next session
2. Standard weight increases:
   - Upper body lifts (Bench, OHP, Rows): Add 2.5 lbs / 1.25 kg per session
   - Lower body lifts (Squat, Deadlift): Add 5 lbs / 2.5 kg per session
3. The AMRAP set provides a gauge of progress - higher rep counts indicate readiness to progress

### Double Progression (Accessory Exercises)

**Applies to:**
- All exercises with 8-12 or 15-20 rep ranges
- Lat work, rows, curls, triceps work, leg press, leg curls, RDLs

**Progression Rules:**
1. Start at the bottom of the rep range (8 reps for 8-12, 15 reps for 15-20)
2. Each session, attempt to add 1 rep to each set
3. When all sets reach the top of the rep range (12 or 20), increase weight and return to the bottom of the range
4. Example: 3x8 -> 3x9 -> 3x10 -> 3x11 -> 3x12 -> increase weight -> 3x8

### Volume-Based Progression (Face Pulls, Calf Raises)

**Applies to:**
- Face Pulls (5x15-20)
- Calf Raises (5x8-12)

**Progression Rules:**
1. Focus on maintaining form and muscle contraction over weight increases
2. Progress weight only when all sets consistently hit the top of the rep range
3. These exercises prioritize volume and time under tension over load

## Deload and Reset Protocols

### When to Deload

The program does not prescribe a fixed deload schedule. Deloads should be taken when:
1. Progress stalls on multiple lifts for 2-3 consecutive sessions
2. Accumulated fatigue affects workout quality
3. Every 6-8 weeks as a proactive measure (recommended)

### Deload Protocol

**Option 1: Volume Deload**
- Reduce sets by 40-50% while maintaining weight
- Example: 4x5 becomes 2x5

**Option 2: Intensity Deload**
- Reduce weight by 10-15% while maintaining volume
- Example: 100 lbs for 4x5 becomes 85-90 lbs for 4x5

**Option 3: Combined Deload**
- Reduce both volume and intensity by approximately 30%

### Reset Protocol

When progress completely stalls on a lift:
1. Reduce the working weight by 10%
2. Rebuild back up using the standard progression scheme
3. The AMRAP sets will be higher during the rebuilding phase, providing additional volume stimulus

## Tracking Template Structure

The spreadsheet provides a logging template with the following structure for each workout:

- **Weight (Wt.)**: Record the load used for each exercise
- **Sets 1-6**: Record actual reps performed for each set

The template extends across 7 weeks, allowing for consistent tracking and identification of progression patterns.

### Layout Options

Two template formats are provided:
1. **Horizontal Layout**: Weeks displayed as columns, days as rows (compact view)
2. **Vertical Layout**: Weeks stacked vertically with full day detail (linear tracking view)

---

## Exercise Substitutions

### Pull Exercises
- Lat Pulldowns can be replaced with Pull-ups or Chin-ups
- Chest Supported Rows can be replaced with Seated Cable Rows

### Push Exercises
- Triceps Pushdowns and Overhead Extensions are interchangeable with other triceps isolation movements
- Lateral Raises remain constant due to shoulder development emphasis

### Leg Exercises
- Exercise selection is fixed; substitutions not typically recommended
- Machine variations acceptable for Leg Press and Leg Curls

## Program Duration

This program is designed for continuous use as long as linear progression remains viable. Typical duration:
- **Beginners**: 3-6 months before transitioning to intermediate programming
- **Early Intermediates**: May continue with modified progression (smaller increments, weekly vs. session progression)

The 7-week tracking template can be repeated indefinitely or extended as needed.
