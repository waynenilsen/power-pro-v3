# Sheiko Beginner Program Specification

## Program Overview

The Sheiko Beginner program is a structured powerlifting training system designed by Boris Sheiko, the legendary Russian powerlifting coach. This program emphasizes high frequency, moderate intensity, and technical mastery through submaximal training.

### Philosophy

The Sheiko method prioritizes:

1. **Technical Perfection** - Weights should be heavy enough to challenge technique but light enough to maintain perfect form on every rep
2. **High Frequency** - Each competition lift is trained 2-3 times per week
3. **Submaximal Training** - Most work is performed at 70-85% of 1RM with occasional heavier singles
4. **Volume Accumulation** - Progress comes from accumulated volume over time rather than maximal efforts
5. **Specificity** - Competition lifts are prioritized with strategic use of variations

### Program Structure

The program consists of two distinct phases:

| Phase | Duration | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Prep Period | 4 weeks (repeatable) | Build base strength and work capacity |
| Comp Period | 4 weeks | Peak for competition or max testing |

**Usage Modes:**
- **Non-competing lifters**: Run multiple Prep cycles, then test new maxes and restart
- **Competing lifters**: Run Prep cycles followed by Comp cycle, timed so Comp Week 4 ends at competition

---

## Input Parameters

The program requires three inputs (1 Rep Maxes):

| Lift | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Squat 1RM | Competition squat maximum |
| Bench 1RM | Competition bench press maximum |
| Deadlift 1RM | Competition deadlift maximum |

All working weights are calculated as percentages of these maxes.

---

## Training Frequency

### Weekly Schedule

Training occurs 3 days per week on non-consecutive days:
- **Day 1**: Monday
- **Day 3**: Wednesday
- **Day 5**: Friday

### Lift Frequency Per Week

**Prep Phase (typical):**
| Lift | Times Per Week |
|------|----------------|
| Squat | 2x |
| Bench | 3x |
| Deadlift | 2x (variations) |

**Comp Phase (varies by week):**
| Week | Squat | Bench | Deadlift |
|------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 | 3x | 3x | 1x |
| 2 | 2x | 3x | 2x |
| 3 | 2x | 3x | 1x |
| 4 | 1x | 2x | 1x |

---

## Percentage-Based Loading System

### Intensity Zones

The program tracks volume across five intensity zones:

| Zone | Percentage Range | Purpose |
|------|-----------------|---------|
| Zone 1 | 50-59% | Warm-up, technique work |
| Zone 2 | 60-69% | Extended warm-up, light work |
| Zone 3 | 70-79% | Primary working zone, volume accumulation |
| Zone 4 | 80-89% | Heavier work sets, strength building |
| Zone 5 | 90%+ | Heavy singles, peaking (Comp phase only) |

### Percentage Ranges by Phase

**Prep Phase:** 50-90%
- Most work concentrated at 70-85%
- Occasional 90% sets on deadlift variations

**Comp Phase:** 50-105%
- Includes test day with 100-105% attempts
- Taper week stays at 50-75%

### Weight Calculation Formula

```
Working Weight = 1RM x Percentage
```

Example: If Squat 1RM = 200kg
- 70% = 200 x 0.70 = 140kg
- 80% = 200 x 0.80 = 160kg

---

## Rep and Set Schemes

### Competition Lifts - Rep Ranges

| Percentage | Typical Reps |
|------------|--------------|
| 50% | 3-5 |
| 60% | 3-5 |
| 70% | 3-4 |
| 75% | 2-3 |
| 80% | 2-3 |
| 85% | 2 |
| 90% | 1-2 |
| 95-105% | 1 |

### Accessory Work - Rep Ranges

| Category | Percentage | Reps | Sets |
|----------|------------|------|------|
| Chest accessories | 65-70% | 6-8 | 4 |
| Triceps work | 65-70% | 6-8 | 4 |
| Back work (rows, lats) | 65-70% | 6-8 | 4-5 |
| Core work | 60-75% | 8-10 | 3 |
| Good mornings | 75% | 4-5 | 4-5 |
| Back extensions | 65% | 8 | 4 |

### Warm-Up Progression Pattern

For competition lifts, the standard warm-up protocol is:

```
50% x 3-5 reps x 1 set
60% x 3-5 reps x 1 set
70% x 3-4 reps x 1 set
[Working sets begin]
```

## Volume Distribution

### Weekly Volume Pattern (Prep Phase)

**Day 1 (Monday) - Highest Volume:**
- Competition Squat: ~21-26 total reps
- Competition Bench: ~20-24 total reps
- 2-3 accessories

**Day 3 (Wednesday) - Deadlift Focus:**
- Deadlift Variation #1: ~17-24 total reps
- Bench Variation or Competition Bench: ~15-26 total reps
- Deadlift Variation #2: ~12-18 total reps
- 1-2 accessories

**Day 5 (Friday) - Moderate Volume:**
- Competition Squat: ~21-24 total reps
- Bench (competition or variation): ~16-24 total reps
- 2-3 accessories

### Volume Calculation

For each exercise set:
```
Total Reps = Reps per Set x Number of Sets
Volume Load = Weight x Total Reps
```

---

## Periodization Model

### Prep Phase (4 Weeks)

The Prep phase uses **linear progression with undulating intensity**:

**Week 1:**
- Moderate intensity focus
- Top sets at 75-80%
- Higher rep ranges (3-4 reps on work sets)
- Introduction of deadlift variations

**Week 2:**
- Slight intensity increase
- Top sets reach 80%
- Volume maintained
- Bench includes 80% x 3 x 5 sets

**Week 3:**
- Peak intensity for prep phase
- Deadlift variations reach 90%
- Bench reaches 85%
- Slightly reduced rep counts (2 reps on heavy sets)

**Week 4:**
- Similar to Week 3
- Top squat sets at 85%
- Top bench sets at 85%
- Deadlift volume reduced
- Acts as transition to next prep cycle or comp phase

### Comp Phase (4 Weeks)

The Comp phase uses **peaking periodization**:

**Week 1 - Test Day:**
- Wednesday includes maximal testing on all three lifts
- Progression: 50% -> 60% -> 70% -> 80% -> 90% -> 95% -> 100% -> 105%
- Establishes new training maxes or practices competition attempts
- Other days maintain moderate work (75% x 2-3 sets)

**Week 2 - Volume Block:**
- Highest volume week of comp phase
- Intensity maintained at 80-95%
- Multiple 80% x 3 x 4-5 sessions
- Good mornings increase to 80%

**Week 3 - Intensity Maintenance:**
- Reduced volume
- Intensity peaks at 85% on main lifts
- Deadlift work limited to 75% for recovery
- Focus on maintaining strength while recovering

**Week 4 - Taper:**
- Dramatically reduced volume and intensity
- Monday: Light bench (75% x 1 x 3), Light deadlift (70% x 2 x 3)
- Wednesday: Light squat (65% x 2 x 3), Light bench (70% x 2 x 3)

## Programming Notes

### Adjusting Training Maxes

- If weights feel too light or heavy, adjust maxes to achieve moderate difficulty
- Weights should be heavy enough to challenge technique but allow perfect form on every rep
- Some workouts are intentionally lighter/easier than others
- If a new PR is achieved during the program, maxes can be updated
- If competition is less than 30 days away, keep existing maxes

### Volume Adjustment Guidelines

- If feeling fatigued, reduce sets on accessories first
- Never skip competition lift work
- Warm-up sets can be reduced but not eliminated
- Working sets are the priority

### Exercise Substitutions

Accessories can be substituted with similar movements:
- Chest muscles: any chest isolation movement
- Lat muscles: any vertical pulling movement
- Seated rows: any horizontal pulling movement
- Back extensions: any hip hinge accessory

### Rest Periods

Not explicitly specified in the program. Recommended guidelines:
- Competition lifts: 3-5 minutes between work sets
- Accessories: 2-3 minutes between sets

## Summary

The Sheiko Beginner program is a systematic approach to powerlifting that emphasizes:

1. **Frequency**: Each lift trained 2-3x per week
2. **Submaximal Loading**: Most work at 70-85%
3. **Technical Focus**: Perfect form prioritized over maximal weights
4. **Strategic Variation**: Deadlift variations develop specific weaknesses
5. **Planned Peaking**: Comp phase systematically prepares for maximal performance

The program is designed to be run continuously with Prep cycles building the base and Comp cycles peaking for meets or max testing.
