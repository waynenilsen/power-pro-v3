# Sheiko Intermediate Program - Small Load Variant

## Program Overview

The Sheiko Intermediate program is a Russian powerlifting methodology designed for intermediate-level lifters. This "Small Load" variant is intended for heavy to superheavy bodyweight male athletes. The program emphasizes high frequency, moderate intensity, and significant training volume across the three competition lifts.

### Program Structure

The complete program consists of three distinct mesocycles:
- **Preparation Period 1 (Prep_1)**: 4 weeks of base building
- **Preparation Period 2 (Prep_2)**: 4 weeks of intensification with max testing
- **Competition Period (Comp)**: 5 weeks tapering to competition

Total program length: 13 weeks

### Training Frequency

All phases use a 3-day per week training schedule:
- Day 1: Monday
- Day 3: Wednesday
- Day 5: Friday

### Load Variants

The spreadsheet is the "Small Load" variant. Sheiko programs come in three load levels based on bodyweight class:
- **Large Load**: Light to medium bodyweight men / Light to heavy bodyweight women
- **Medium Load**: Medium to heavy bodyweight men / Heavy to superheavy bodyweight women
- **Small Load**: Heavy to superheavy bodyweight men (this program)

## Key Differentiators from Sheiko Beginner

1. **Higher Intensity Ranges**: Intermediate regularly works up to 85-95% in preparation phases and includes max testing at 100-105%
2. **More Exercise Variations**: Includes deficit deadlifts, deadlifts from boxes, paused deadlifts, and various bench press variations
3. **Double Main Lift Sessions**: Many workouts include the same main lift performed twice (e.g., squat-bench-squat or bench-deadlift-bench)
4. **Max Testing Week**: Prep_2 Week 2 includes singles up to 105% for all three lifts
5. **Longer Competition Taper**: 5-week comp phase with progressive volume reduction
6. **More Accessory Variety**: Includes leg extensions, seated DB press, and multiple good morning variations

## Intensity Zones and Rep Prescriptions

### Standard Warm-up Progression
All main lifts follow a consistent warm-up pattern:
- 50% x 3-5 reps x 1 set
- 60% x 3-4 reps x 1 set
- 70% x 3 reps x 1 set

### Working Set Prescriptions by Phase

#### Preparation Period 1 (Weeks 1-4)

|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| 70-75%    | 2-4 reps     | 4-5 sets     |
| 80%       | 2 reps       | 2-4 sets     |
| 85%       | 1-2 reps     | 2-3 sets     |

## Volume Distribution by Phase

### Preparation Period 1 - Weekly Rep Totals (Approximate)

| Week | Squat Reps | Bench Reps | Deadlift Reps |
|------|------------|------------|---------------|
| 1    | 45         | 125        | 18            |
| 2    | 55         | 67         | 14            |
| 3    | 48         | 98         | 32            |
| 4    | 42         | 82         | 31            |

**Key Pattern**: Bench press volume is consistently highest. Week 1 emphasizes volume accumulation while Week 4 increases intensity with reduced volume.

### Preparation Period 2 - Weekly Rep Totals (Approximate)

| Week | Squat Reps | Bench Reps | Deadlift Reps |
|------|------------|------------|---------------|
| 1    | 58         | 68         | 28            |
| 2    | 76         | 67         | 15            |
| 3    | 58         | 75         | 30            |
| 4    | 41         | 95         | 30            |

**Key Pattern**: Week 2 is the max testing week - despite lower deadlift volume, includes singles at 100-105%. Week 4 maintains high bench volume for peaking.

### Competition Period - Weekly Rep Totals (Approximate)

| Week | Squat Reps | Bench Reps | Deadlift Reps |
|------|------------|------------|---------------|
| 1    | 62         | 96         | 29            |
| 2    | 33         | 73         | 15            |
| 3    | 45         | 67         | 16            |
| 4    | 32         | 43         | 11            |
| 5    | 10         | 25         | 15            |

**Key Pattern**: Progressive volume reduction leading to competition. Week 5 is a significant taper with minimal volume.

## Periodization Model

### Macrocycle Structure (13 Weeks)

```
PREP 1 (Weeks 1-4)     PREP 2 (Weeks 5-8)     COMP (Weeks 9-13)
|---Volume Base---|    |--Intensification--|   |-----Taper/Peak-----|
                              |
                        Max Testing Week
```

### Within-Phase Periodization

**Prep 1:**
- Week 1: Volume accumulation at moderate intensity (70-75%)
- Week 2: Similar volume, introduction of 80% work
- Week 3: Increased deadlift work, 85% introduced
- Week 4: Intensity peak with 85-90% work, slight volume reduction

**Prep 2:**
- Week 1: High volume with 80-85% intensity
- Week 2: MAX TESTING WEEK - Singles up to 105%
- Week 3: Recovery week with moderate intensity
- Week 4: Intensity maintenance, volume reduction

**Competition:**
- Week 1: Moderate volume, high intensity (80-90%)
- Week 2: Reduced volume, maintained intensity
- Week 3: Further volume reduction
- Week 4: Significant taper begins
- Week 5: Minimal volume taper + competition

## Program Implementation Notes

### Weight Calculation
All percentages are based on current 1RM:
- **Weight = 1RM x Percentage**
- Round to nearest available weight (typically 2.5kg/5lb increments)
- Accessories at listed percentages are relative to the main lift (e.g., Good Morning at 65% = 65% of Squat max)

### Max Adjustment Protocol
From the program instructions:
- If you achieve a new PR during training, you may adjust maxes
- If competition is less than 30 days away, keep original maxes
- Adjust maxes so you achieve "good moderate difficulty - heavy but allows perfect technique"

### Running the Program
- **Not Competing**: Run Prep cycles repeatedly, test new maxes, restart
- **Competing**: Run any number of Prep cycles, then Comp cycle timed to end at competition
- **Cycle Length Adjustment**: Adjust program timing so Week 5 of Comp ends at competition week

### Load Adjustment
If weights feel too light or heavy:
- Inflate or deflate training maxes by 2.5-5%
- Some workouts are intentionally lighter/easier than others
- Perfect technique should be maintainable on all sets

## Volume Tracking Metrics

The program tracks the following for each workout:
- Total reps per lift
- Total tonnage (weight x reps) per lift
- Rep distribution by percentage range:
  - 50-59%
  - 60-69%
  - 70-79%
  - 80-89%
  - 90%+

This allows athletes to monitor:
- Weekly volume accumulation
- Intensity distribution changes across phases
- Recovery demands based on heavy work volume

## Summary

The Sheiko Intermediate Small Load program is characterized by:

1. **High Frequency**: Each main lift trained 2-3 times per week
2. **Moderate Intensity Focus**: Primary work at 70-85%, with strategic high-intensity peaks
3. **High Total Volume**: Especially for bench press (100+ weekly reps in early phases)
4. **Variation Cycling**: Deadlift variations rotate throughout to address weaknesses
5. **Double Main Lift Sessions**: Unique feature allowing extra frequency without extra training days
6. **Planned Peaking**: Max testing in Prep 2, followed by strategic taper to competition
7. **Russian Periodization Principles**: Emphasis on technical proficiency through submaximal, high-volume work

The program differs from beginner Sheiko by including higher intensities, more exercise variations, max testing phases, and a more sophisticated periodization structure leading to competition.
