# 5/3/1 Building the Monolith - Complete Program Specification

## Program Overview

**5/3/1 Building the Monolith** is a 6-week strength and hypertrophy program created by Jim Wendler. It is designed as a challenging, high-volume program that combines the proven 5/3/1 percentage-based progression with extremely high accessory volume. The program is notorious for its demanding workload and is intended for intermediate to advanced lifters looking to build significant muscle mass and strength simultaneously.

### Philosophy

The program embodies the "more is more" philosophy for a short, focused training block. It pairs heavy compound lifts with extraordinarily high-volume accessory work (100 chin-ups, 100-200 dips per session) to create a potent hypertrophy stimulus. The program also includes specific dietary recommendations emphasizing high protein and caloric intake.

## Training Max Calculation

The program uses Jim Wendler's standard Training Max (TM) concept:

**Training Max = 1 Rep Max (1RM) x 0.85 (85%)**

This conservative training max ensures quality repetitions and sustainable progression. Users input their actual 1RM for each lift, and the program automatically calculates the TM.

### Main Lifts
- **Squat**
- **Bench Press**
- **Overhead Press (Press)**
- **Deadlift**

---

## Program Structure

The program consists of **two 3-week cycles** for a total of **6 weeks**.

### Cycle Progression

After the first 3-week cycle, the Training Max increases for each lift:
- **Bench Press**: +2.5 kg / +5 lbs
- **Press**: +2.5 kg / +5 lbs
- **Deadlift**: +5 kg / +10 lbs
- **Squat**: +5 kg / +10 lbs

---

## Weekly Training Schedule

Training occurs **3 days per week**: Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.

### Day Structure Overview

| Day | Primary Focus | Key Features |

## Dietary Recommendations

While not explicitly detailed in this spreadsheet version, Jim Wendler's original Building the Monolith program includes specific dietary requirements:

### Recommended Daily Intake
- **1.5 lbs of ground beef** (or equivalent protein source)
- **12 eggs**
- **Adequate carbohydrates** to support training volume

### General Guidelines
- High protein intake is essential for recovery
- Caloric surplus is recommended for muscle growth
- The program is designed for those willing to eat aggressively
- Not suitable for those in a caloric deficit

---

## Implementation Notes

### Rounding
- All weights should be rounded to the nearest available plate increment
- Kg version typically rounds to 2.5 kg increments
- Lbs version typically rounds to 2.5 or 5 lb increments

### Rest Periods
- Main lifts: 3-5 minutes between heavy sets
- Accessory work: Minimal rest, superset where possible
- 100-rep challenges can be broken into any set/rep scheme

### Progression
- Complete all 6 weeks before testing new maxes
- If unable to complete prescribed work, reduce Training Max by 10%
- Focus on completing all accessory volume before adding weight

### Program Suitability
- Intermediate to advanced lifters
- Those with adequate recovery capacity
- Lifters willing to commit to high caloric intake
- Not recommended for beginners or those in a caloric deficit

## Formula Reference for Spreadsheet Recreation

### Training Max Calculation
```
Training Max = 1RM x 0.85
```

### Working Weight Calculations
```
Working Weight = Training Max x Percentage
```

### Cycle 2 Training Max
```
Upper Body TM (Cycle 2) = Cycle 1 TM + 2.5 (kg) or + 5 (lbs)
Lower Body TM (Cycle 2) = Cycle 1 TM + 5 (kg) or + 10 (lbs)
```

### Week Percentage Patterns
```
Week 1: 70%, 80%, 90%
Week 2: 65%, 75%, 85%
Week 3: 75%, 85%, 95%
```

These patterns repeat in Weeks 4-6 with the updated Training Max values.

## Summary

5/3/1 Building the Monolith is an intensive 6-week program that combines:
- Percentage-based progression on main lifts
- High volume (7-8 sets) on squat and deadlift days
- Brutal accessory volume (100+ reps of chin-ups, dips, curls)
- Progressive overload through Training Max increases
- Friday "Widowmaker" 20-rep squat sets

The program demands commitment to both training and nutrition, making it one of the most challenging variations in the 5/3/1 family of programs.
