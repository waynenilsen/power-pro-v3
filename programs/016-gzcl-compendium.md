## Overview

The GZCL Method is a flexible strength training framework built around a three-tier system that prioritizes compound movements while allowing for individualization. This compendium includes multiple program variants designed for different training goals, experience levels, and frequencies.

---

## Core GZCL Principles

### The Three-Tier System

The GZCL Method organizes training into three tiers based on intensity, volume, and movement specificity:

#### Tier 1 (T1) - Primary Compound Movements
- **Purpose**: Build maximal strength in competition lifts
- **Movements**: Competition lifts (squat, bench press, deadlift) or close variations
- **Intensity**: High (80-100% of Training Max)
- **Volume**: Low (typically 10-25 total reps)
- **Rep Ranges**: 1-5 reps per set
- **Sets**: 3-10+ sets depending on program phase

**T1 Movement Selection Guidelines**:
- Should be competition lifts: Back Squat, Bench Press, Deadlift
- Exceptions: OHP and close variations of competition lifts
- Examples of acceptable close variations: Front Squat, Close Grip Bench, Sling Shot Bench, High Bar/Low Bar variations, opposite stance deadlift

#### Tier 2 (T2) - Secondary Compound Movements
- **Purpose**: Build strength in variations that support T1 lifts; address weaknesses
- **Movements**: Close variations of T1 lifts or complementary compound movements
- **Intensity**: Moderate (60-80% of Training Max)
- **Volume**: Moderate-High (typically 20-40 total reps)
- **Rep Ranges**: 5-12 reps per set
- **Sets**: 3-5 sets typically

**T2 Movement Selection Guidelines**:
- Should be close variations of competition lifts
- Examples: Close Grip Bench Press, Incline Bench, Front Squat, Deficit Deadlift, Stiff Leg Deadlift, Pause variations
- Close variations can be estimated more accurately based on T1 ability (e.g., Close Grip Bench based on Bench Press max)
- Incline Bench and similar movements cannot be as accurately estimated from T1 performance

#### Tier 3 (T3) - Accessories
- **Purpose**: Build muscle, address weaknesses, injury prevention
- **Movements**: Isolation exercises, machine work, bodybuilding movements
- **Intensity**: Low (RPE-based or 10RM+ weights)
- **Volume**: High (30-50+ total reps)
- **Rep Ranges**: 10-20+ reps per set
- **Sets**: 3-5 MRS (Max Rep Sets)

**T3 Examples**:
- **Deadlift/Back Support**: Pull-ups, rows, lat pulldowns, good mornings
- **Upper Pressing Support**: Lateral raises, rear delt flies, pec flies, tricep work
- **Squatting Support**: Leg extensions, leg curls, lunges, leg press

---

## Training Max Concept

The **Training Max (TM)** is central to GZCL programming:
- Defined as an estimated **daily 2RM** (a weight you can double on any given day)
- Should be approximately 85-90% of your true 1RM
- Entered as a decimal for percentage calculations (e.g., 0.85 = 85%)
- Should be a conservative estimate that allows for consistent progress

**Important**: Do NOT use actual 1RM values. Use rep maxes you can hit reliably.

---

## Program Variants Included

### 1. VDIP (Volume-Dependent Intensity Progression)

**Structure**: 5 days per week, ongoing (no set duration)

**Concept**: Progression is determined by total rep performance rather than fixed progression schemes. Volume achieved dictates whether weight increases.

**Intensity Setup**:
- T1 Starting Intensity: 85% of Training Max
- T2 Starting Intensity: 65% of Training Max
- T3: Fixed weights based on 10RM capability

**Rep Scheme**:
- T1: 3 MRS (Max Rep Sets) at prescribed intensity
- T2: 3 MRS at prescribed intensity
- T3a/T3b: 4 MRS each (often superset)

**VDIP Progression Rules**:

**T1 Progression**:
| Total Reps in 3 MRS | Action |
|---------------------|--------|
| 15 or more | Add 10 lb next week |
| 10-14 | Add 5 lb next week |
| Less than 10 | Maintain weight |

**T2 Progression**:
| Total Reps in 3 MRS | Action |
|---------------------|--------|
| 30 or more | Add 10 lb next week |
| 25-29 | Add 5 lb next week |
| Less than 25 | Maintain weight |

**T3 Progression**:
| Total Reps in 4 MRS | Action |
|---------------------|--------|
| 50 or more | Add 5 lb next week |
| Less than 50 | Maintain weight |

**Sample VDIP Week Layout**:
- Day 1: Back Squat (T1), Stiff Leg Deadlift (T2), Lunges + Pull-ups (T3)
- Day 2: Bench Press (T1), Spoto Bench (T2), Close Grip Bench + DB Press (T3)
- Day 3: Deadlift (T1), Front Squat (T2), Rows + Cable Rows (T3)
- Day 4: OHP (T1), Push Press (T2), Incline Bench + Dips (T3)
- Day 5: Front Squat (T1), Back Squat (T2), Barbell Row + Curls (T3)

### 2. Jacked & Tan 2.0 (J&T 2.0)

**Structure**: 12 weeks, 4 days per week

**Concept**: Hybrid program combining rep max (RM) finding with percentage-based follow-up work. Designed to build both strength and muscle mass simultaneously.

**Program Phases**:

**Block 1 (Weeks 1-6) - Mesocycles A & B**:
Find current Rep Max ability, then build work capacity based on Training Max with AMRAPs to drive progress.

| Week | T1 RM Finding | T1 Follow-up (% of RM) | Sets |
|------|---------------|------------------------|------|
| 1 | Find 10RM | 70% x 6 | 3+ |
| 2 | Find 8RM | 75% x 5 | 3+ |
| 3 | Find 6RM | 80% x 4 | 3+ |
| 4 | Find 4RM | 82.5% x 3 | 3+ |
| 5 | Find 2RM | 85% x 2 | 4+ |
| 6 | Find 1RM | Test Week | - |

**Block 2 (Weeks 7-12) - Mesocycles C & D**:
More aggressive RM finding followed by percentage-based work off that RM.

| Week | T1 RM Finding | T1 Follow-up (% of RM) | Sets |
|------|---------------|------------------------|------|
| 7 | Find 6RM | 85% x 3 | 5+ |
| 8 | Find 4RM | 85% x 2 | 5+ |
| 9 | Find 2RM | 85% x 1 | 5+ |
| 10 | Find 5RM | 90% x 2 | 3+ |
| 11 | Find 3RM | 90% x 1 | 3+ |
| 12 | Find 1RM | Test | - |

**T2 Structure**:
- T2a: Primary T2 movement with fixed weight/rep progression
- T2b/T2c: Secondary movements using 3 MRS

**T2a Rep Progression** (Weeks 1-5):
| Week | Intensity | Reps | Sets |
|------|-----------|------|------|
| 1 | 50% | 10 | 4 |
| 2 | 55-60% | 8 | 4 |
| 3 | 60-70% | 6 | 4 |
| 4 | 65-75% | 4 | 5 |
| 5 | 70-80% | 2 | 7 |
| 6 | T2 Rest | - | - |

**T3 Rep Progression** (using MRS):
| Week | Target Reps | Sets |
|------|-------------|------|
| 1 | 20 | 3 MRS |
| 2 | 18 | 3 MRS |
| 3 | 16 | 3 MRS |
| 4 | 14 | 3 MRS |
| 5 | 12 | 3 MRS |
| 6 | 10 | 3 MRS |

**Week 6 Notes**:
- T1 Test Week: Find true 1RM
- T2 Deload Week: No T2 work
- T3: Reduce volume, continue with 10 reps x 3 MRS

**Week 7 Notes**:
- T3 Rest all days
- Consider switching some T2 & T3 movements for variety in Block 2

**AMRAP Guidance**:
- (+) notation means last set is a rep-out (AMRAP)
- When feeling bad, skip the AMRAP
- Goal: 2x the written reps on AMRAP sets
- Always leave 1-2 reps in the tank

- Day 3: Deficit Deadlift (T1), Legs Up Bench (T2)
- Day 4: Sling Shot Bench (T1), Paused Deadlift (T2)
- Day 5: Front Squat (T1), Close Grip Bench (T2)
- Day 6-7: Rest

**General Guidance**:

### 4. Deadlift Wave Forms (DLWF) - 6, 9, and 12 Week Variants

**Structure**: 6, 9, or 12 weeks, 2-3 deadlift days per week

**Concept**: Specialized deadlift peaking program using wave periodization with exercise variations targeting specific weaknesses.

**Two Progression Tracks**:

**Progression A (Floor Speed Focus)**:
Targets: Deficit variations, paused work, banded pulls

**Progression B (Lockout Strength Focus)**:
Targets: Block/rack pulls, banded work, paused variations

**12-Week Wave Form Structure**:

| Phase | Weeks | Primary Focus |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| Phase 1 | 1-3 | Deadlift + 2" Deficit |
| Phase 2 | 4-6 | Deficit + Paused variations |
| Phase 3 | 7-9 | Paused + Band work |
| Phase 4 | 10-12 | Band/Block variations + Competition DL |

**Week 1 (Example - 12 Week)**:
- Day 1: Find 3RM Deadlift (no belt), then work at 80% for straight sets
- Day 3: 2" Deficit Deadlift at 75%

**Intensity Ranges by Phase**:
| Phase | Primary Intensity | Secondary Intensity |
|-------|------------------|---------------------|
| 1-3 | 80-90% (of 3RM) | 70-80% (of 3RM) |
| 4-6 | 80-90% (of 2RM) | 70-80% (of 2RM) |
| 7-9 | 80-90% (of 1RM) | 75-80% (of 1RM) |
| 10-12 | 85-95% (of 1RM) | 80-85% (of 1RM) |

**Band Tension Guidelines**:
- Band tension should be approximately 30% of the paused 1RM established in Phase 3
- When using bands: add straight weight only, keep band tension constant
- When deloading with bands: reduce straight weight only, maintain band tension

**Volume Targets (12-Week)**:
| Weeks | Day 1 Volume | Day 2 Volume |
|-------|--------------|--------------|
| 1-3 | 9+, 9+, 8+ | 17+, 17+, 9+ |
| 4-6 | 8+, 10+, 5+ | 13, 13, 9 |
| 7-9 | 3+, 7+, 5+ | 10+, 10+, 5+ |
| 10-12 | 4+, 5+, 2+ | 8+, 8+, 3+ |

### 5. The Rippler

**Structure**: 12 weeks, 4 days per week

**Concept**: Wave-based periodization with three distinct phases (Trough, Shoulder, Crest) creating an undulating intensity pattern.

**Phase Structure**:
- **The Trough** (Weeks 1-3): Foundation building
- **The Shoulder** (Weeks 4-6): Intensity building
- **The Crest** (Weeks 7-9): Peak intensity
- **Peak/Test** (Weeks 10-12): Testing and tapering

**T1 Progression Schedule**:

| Week | Intensity (% of 2RM) | Reps | Sets | Notes |
|------|---------------------|------|------|-------|

| 10 | 100% | 3 | 5+ | AMRAP last set |
| 11-12 | Rest | Rest | Rest | |

**T3 Progression**:
- Based on weights you can lift for 10+ reps per set
- Volume decreases over the 12 weeks

| Week Range | Sets |
|------------|------|
| Weeks 1-3 | 5 |
| Weeks 4-6 | 4 |
| Weeks 7-9 | 3 |
| Weeks 10-11 | 2-3 |

**T3 Weight Progression Guidelines**:

Adjust weights every 3 weeks based on total reps achieved:

**Week 3 (after Weeks 1-3)**:
| Total Reps | Action |
|------------|--------|
| 70+ | Add 15 lb |
| 60+ | Add 10 lb |
| 50+ | Add 5 lb |

**Week 6 (after Weeks 4-6)**:
| Total Reps | Action |
|------------|--------|
| 60+ | Add 15 lb |
| 50+ | Add 10 lb |
| 40+ | Add 5 lb |

**Week 9 (after Weeks 7-9)**:
| Total Reps | Action |
|------------|--------|
| 50+ | Add 15 lb |
| 40+ | Add 10 lb |
| 30+ | Add 5 lb |

**Goal Weight Entry**:
- T1: Enter your 2RM (weight you can double daily)

## Volume Landmarks and Guidelines

### Minimum Effective Volume (MEV)
- T1: 10+ weekly reps per movement pattern
- T2: 20+ weekly reps per movement pattern
- T3: 30+ weekly reps per muscle group

### Maximum Recoverable Volume (MRV)
- T1: 25-30 weekly reps per movement pattern
- T2: 50-60 weekly reps per movement pattern
- T3: 100+ weekly reps per muscle group (individual variation)

### Volume Progression Strategy
1. Start at MEV
2. Add volume weekly until approaching MRV
3. Deload when recovery is compromised
4. Repeat with slightly higher baseline

## Key Programming Rules

### AMRAP/Rep-Out Guidelines
- (+) notation indicates last set is an AMRAP (As Many Reps As Possible)
- **Never** go to actual failure
- Always leave 1-2 reps in the tank
- When feeling bad, skip the AMRAP entirely

### Recovery Management
If feeling run down:
1. Leave 2-3 reps in tank on all T1/T2 AMRAP sets
2. Volume deload: decrease all T3 movements by one set for the week
3. Eat 250-500 extra calories for 2 days
4. Get 30-60 extra minutes of sleep per night

### Rest Periods
- T1: 3-5 minutes between sets
- T2: 2-3 minutes between sets
- T3: 60-90 seconds between sets (or supersetted)

### MRS (Max Rep Sets)
When "MRS" is indicated:
1. Work up to your target rep weight in 3-4 warm-up sets
2. Once you reach the target weight, that's your first working set
3. Perform the prescribed number of additional sets at that weight
4. Each set is performed for max reps (leaving 1-2 in tank)

---

## Formulas and Calculations

### Training Max Calculation
```
Training Max = Estimated Daily 2RM = True 1RM x 0.85-0.90
```

### Working Weight Calculation
```
Working Weight = Training Max x Prescribed Percentage
```

### Tonnage Calculation
```
Tonnage = Weight x Reps x Sets
Weekly Tonnage = Sum of all movement tonnages
```

### Rep Total Calculation
```
Rep Total = Sum of reps across all sets of a given tier/movement
```

---

## Notes on Spreadsheet Usage

- **Yellow cells**: User input areas (Training Max, dates, movements)
- **Calculated cells**: Do not modify unless you understand the formulas
- All weights auto-calculate based on Training Max and prescribed percentages
- Dates auto-advance based on starting date input
- Training notes sections are provided for logging actual performance

### Weight Input Methods
- For T1/T2 based on Training Max: Enter decimal (e.g., 0.85 for 85%)
- For T3 movements: Enter actual weight in pounds or kilograms
- Some T3 entries show "?" indicating user should select appropriate weight
